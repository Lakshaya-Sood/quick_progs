Cloud Computing("the cloud") -> Computing as a service over the internet
SERVICE INCLUDES:
Elastic resources — Scale up or down quickly and easily to meet demand
Metered service so you only pay for what you use
Self service — All the IT resources you need with self-service access

(*aaS) as a service(Cloud Service models):just get a clear picture of benefits and challenge in each of these
1)(SaaS) Software as a service => Cloud-based applications - run on distant computers 
e.g.:- BI tools, collaboration tools, SAP, CRM, HRD
CRM(customer relationship management) tools -> Microsoft Dynamics 365

Also pick your:- office suits, CRM, financial planning, human resources, SCM

-----------------------------
2)(PaaS) Platform as a service => support the complete life-cycle of building and delivering web-based (cloud) applications — without the cost and complexity of buying and managing the underlying hardware, software, provisioning, and hosting
eg:- Languages, software supporting / IDE, runtime environment

SAAS will serve[Data&Application] to be configured by user
underlying infrastructure[<-Runtime-> middle-ware<-OS and virtualization-> Network <-Storage-> Hardware&Processing] user have no control over this

Also pick your - 
-App server(like oracle web-logic, IBM web-sphere, jboss)
-webserver (like Apache, iis7)
-database server(like oracle)
-middle-ware (like ESB, EAI, MOM, ORB)
-development environment (like all languages C, C#, python Java )

user will create [Data&Application]
PaaS will serve [ <-Runtime-> middle-ware] to be configured by user
underlying infrastructure will automatically be managed[<-OS and virtualization-> Network <-Storage-> Hardware&Processing] user have no control over this

-----------------------------
3)(IaaS) Infrastructure as a service => provides companies with computing resources including servers, networking, storage, and data center space on a pay-per-use basis.
eg:- storage, computing, RAM, processor, network etc

Also pick your - os, firewall, router, load balancer
analogy of traditional IT infrastructure & IAAS => owning a car vs renting a car(user is responsible for what it does with the car) 

user will create [Data&Application <-Runtime-> middleware] 
IAAS will serve[<-OS and virtualization-> Network <-Storage-> Hardware&Processing] to be configured by user

Types of cloud computing models:
1)Public cloud
2)Private cloud
3)Community cloud
4)Hybrid cloud

Datacenter - https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/20psgp/eli5_what_is_a_data_center_and_what_do_they/
sand-boxed environments - "Even though VMs can run on the same physical hardware, they are still logically separated from each other. This means that if one VM experiences an error, crash or a malware attack, it doesn’t extend to other VMs on the same machine, or even other machines."

Virtualization is the ability to run multiple virtual machines on a single piece of hardware. The hardware runs software which enables you to install multiple operating systems which are able to run simultaneously and independently, in their own secure environment, with minimal reduction in performance. Each virtual machine has its own virtual CPU, network interfaces, storage and operating system.

Why Virtualize? -> 
	as the demand for servers increases in datacenters, 
	its  growth/scalability becomes difficult due to factors like:-
		-Increased power and cooling costs
		-physical space constraints
		-man power
		-interconnection complexity

MUST READ: https://www.networkworld.com/article/3243262/virtualization/what-is-a-hypervisor.html
A hypervisor or virtual machine monitor (VMM) is computer software, firmware or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines. A computer on which a hypervisor runs one or more virtual machines is called a host machine, and each virtual machine is called a guest machine. The hypervisor presents the guest operating systems with a virtual operating platform and manages the execution of the guest operating systems. Multiple instances of a variety of operating systems may share the virtualized hardware resources: for example, Linux, Windows, and macOS instances can all run on a single physical x86 machine. This contrasts with operating-system-level virtualization, where all instances (usually called containers) must share a single kernel, though the guest operating systems can differ in user space, such as different Linux distributions with the same kernel...

The hypervisor is an additional layer between physical and virtual spheres; it manages the system’s hardware resources so they are distributed efficiently among virtual machines (VMs).
--------
There are two types of hypervisors, creatively named Type 1 or Type 2. 
1)Type 1 hypervisors, sometimes called “native” or “bare metal” hypervisors, run directly on the host’s hardware to control the hardware and manage the guest VMs. Modern hypervisors include Xen, Oracle VM Server for SPARC, Oracle VM Server for x86, Microsoft Hyper-V and VMware’s ESX/ESXi.
2)Type 2 hypervisors, sometimes called “hosted hypervisors,” run on a conventional OS, just like other applications on the system. In this case, a guest OS runs as a process on the host, while the hypervisors separate the guest OS from the host OS. Examples of Type 2 hypervisors include VMware Workstation, VMware Player, VirtualBox and Parallels Desktop for Mac.
