things done in traditional IT infrastructure
  -new version upgrade (name explains all)
  -optimal resource utilization (memory and Cpu usage in a balanced way)
  -network management (request over internet mangement)
  -database management (doing fast DB operations whiout corrupting DB)
  -security (protect application and its data from external attacks)
  
on-demand computing resources over the internet on a pay-as-you-go pricing model.
a company that provides this solution is called Cloud Service Provider (CSP).

cloud hosting is a more ideal option for startup companies that have a great need for flexibility at a lower budget, while on-premise hosting is typically a better choice for established companies with existing IT infrastructure that can support the services they need.

GCP(Google cloud platform) offers various tools and services which helps in 
-managing infrastructure (reduces the infrastructure cost, set up time and the maintenance cost)
-provisioning servers (is secure and easily scalable across locations)
-configuring networks (can be customized to improve throughput , availability and response time)


 NIST(National Institute of Standards and Technology) definition lists five essential characteristics of cloud computing

 google cloud datastore is a database while google cloud storage is for storage of files that can be stored
 
 in google cloud DATAstore (DB) 
 no of reads > no of writes > no of deletes (often seen in many applications)
 
 Google stack driver(Why Expensive?)
	-> amount of logs of an application keeps increasing quickly over time 
		-> cost is very high as compared to other parts 
			-> reason because in real time production environment, the ability to finds logs for a bug quickly is invaluable
			
GCP pricing philosophy ->
	- Minute based billing
	- Sustained Use discount (the more you use the more discount you will get)
	- Custom Machine types (create a virtual machine that you like)
	- Pre-emptible instances (economical for batch processing jobs)
Google's social responsibility -> environment friendly and Google open source contributions

GCP infrastructure->
	-Physical
		-Backbone network(fibre optic cable)
		-Data Centre (efficient)
