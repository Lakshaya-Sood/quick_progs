-terminal servers (like Citrix)
-Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years
-Type 1 & Type 2 hypervisors
-Debit is what you pay and Credit is what somebody else pays for you
  
-vertical scaling = {  // changing the size of individual node  
		toIncease: "Scale Up",
		toDecrease: "Scale Down"
		}
-Horizontal scaling = { //changing the number of node 
		toIncease: "Scale Out",
		toDecrease: "Scale In"
		}
-our intellectual powers are rather geared to master static relations and that our powers to visualize processes evolving in time are relatively poorly developed
- programming paradigms
- Different Vendors = Different Ideas and Concepts. Like every other Programming Problem...every developer solutes it differently and that's great.PostgreSQL, SQLite, 	  MySQL, MS SQL are just database management systems from different vendors
