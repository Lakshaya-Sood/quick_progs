-terminal servers (like Citrix)
-Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years
-Type 1 & Type 2 hypervisors
-Debit is what you pay and Credit is what somebody else pays for you
  
-vertical scaling = {  // changing the size of individual node  
		toIncease: "Scale Up",
		toDecrease: "Scale Down"
		}
-Horizontal scaling = { //changing the number of node 
		toIncease: "Scale Out",
		toDecrease: "Scale In"
		}
-our intellectual powers are rather geared to master static relations and that our powers to visualize processes evolving in time are relatively poorly developed
- programming paradigms
- Different Vendors = Different Ideas and Concepts. Like every other Programming Problem...every developer solutes it differently and that's great.
  PostgreSQL, SQLite,MySQL, MS SQL are just database management systems from different vendors
- script(is interpreted directly) vs program(is compiled, converted into binary/byte/machine code and then executed)
- http header of response (meta data about the things served by web server)
	- Content-Encoding types :- gzip, compress, deflates, identity, br
	- Content-Type Syntax :- "media-type;charset;boundary"
	- server :- name of the web server applications used by the one severing response
- A daemon is typically a system process running in background - most of the times waiting for an event to occur, or can provide certain services.
	like a webserver listening on some port is daemon(waiting for request to come)
- https://www.netcraft.com -> contains the various surveys related to web & internet
- A/B testing (keeping some traffic on A and rest on B, just to test/observe A) w.r.t testing different versions of the same server
- A proxy server is a computer that acts as an intermediary between the user's computer and the Internet. It allows client computers to make indirect network connections to
  other network services. Nowadays, we use proxy server for various purpose like sharing Internet connections on a local area network, hide our IP address, implement 
  Internet access control, access blocked websites and so on
- there are protocols for just sending(like SMTP) and receiving(like POP3, IMAP) mails.
- HTTPS = HTTP + SSL(secure layer)
- threading based(new thread for each new process that will take a part of hardware and blocks if some process is waiting for something) 
  vs 
  event driven based(everything in a single thread like node, redis & nginx)
- Apache vs nGinX
So if we have multiple threads that are all event driven then this will the most powerful thing in terms of hardware utilization and handling a huge amount of request 
- JavaScript(event loop -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ )
	-> callstack (when error shows stack to trace/ error shows maximum stack exceeded)
	-> Web browser APi - where inbuilt functions are executes (also if any new was registered)

- Linus Flavours types
	- Red hat based
	- Debian based
