Tint - If a color is made lighter by adding white, the result is called a tint.
Shade - If black is added, the darker version is called a shade.
Tone - If gray is added, the result is a different tone.

warm colors are Red, Orange and Yellow

There are two ways colors are combined- (ref- http://printingcode.runemadsen.com/lecture-color/)
1) subtractive - 
   -- All colors created with PAINT or INK will combine in a subtractive way
   -- means mixing all the paint colors will create black instead of white
2) additive - 
  -- All colors created with LIGHT will combine in a additive way
  -- means presence of all color is white while absence is black
