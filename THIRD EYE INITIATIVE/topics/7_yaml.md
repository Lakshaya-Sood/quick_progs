# YAML

## All-In-All

> YAML is a data serialization language which means it's basically just used to
> store information about different things and we can use the YAML to define key
> value pairs things like variables lists and objects and YAML was actually very
> similar to another language called JSON(JavaScript object notation). If you're
> familiar with JSON YAML was basically doing the same thing except, YAML
> places a huge emphasis on readability and user friendliness so all YAML code is
> designed to be super readable and super clean so whenever you're writing the YAML
> you always want to keep that in the  back of your mind that YAML is designed to
> be clean and designed to be easy to read. You can define YAML files in two
> ways so with two different extensions one is (.yml) and the other is (.yaml)
> it doesn't matter which one you use that both going to work

        <li>Spaces and tabs should not be mixed and quotes are not needed in
