### list of best source code hosts for open source projects?

SourceForge (out of order due to junkware-wrapping scandal)
-download the executable of the file
-centeralized development
-gives developer more control
-bad UI
-less community support
Github
-download the source code of file
-decentralized development called forking
-anybody can take control from developer with just minor forking
-good UI
-more community support
github took over source forge and now is the market leader (#network-effect)
honorable mentions - Fosshub, GitLab, Bitbucket

### list of versions of chrome and firefox?

(in order of stability)

1. Google Chrome : canary < developer < beta < stable
2. FireFox: Nightly < developer < beta < stable

### breif overview of browser engines?

Because the Web platform is a set of open standards, there are multiple browser engine implementations.

Gecko is Mozilla's browser engine, used in its Firefox web browser, the Thunderbird email client,
and the SeaMonkey internet suite.Goanna is a fork of Gecko used in the Pale Moon browser.

Apple created the WebKit engine for its Safari browser by forking the KHTML engine of the KDE project.

Google originally used WebKit for its Chrome browser but eventually forked it to create the Blink engine.
All Chromium-based browsers use Blink, as do applications built with CEF, Electron, or any other framework that embeds Chromium.

Although Apple permits third-party browsers as alternatives to Safari on iOS devices, all browsers
distributed through its App Store must use WebKit as their engine. For example, Opera Mini for iOS uses WebKit, whereas all other Opera variants use Blink. (Opera formerly used its own proprietary Presto engine.)

Microsoft formerly developed its own proprietary browser engines, Trident and EdgeHTML, but now uses Blink for its Edge browser
