M -> starting point of the pen 
     eg:- M100, 100
Absolute/relative positioning
L/l -> line from current point to next(X,Y)
    eg:- L150, 150
A/a -> arc from current point to next (X,Y)
    eg:- A50,50 0 1,1 100,150  ....... three points on mid play a very imp role [0 1,1]
        starting two points are the radius of curve cx and cy
        last two points the coordinates for final points
        three points in the mid means
         1st= denotes the rotation of the full cirle/ellipse (from which we are just showing a part)
         2nd(large-arc-flag)= denotes if arc will be bigger or smaller(1-> bigger and 0->smaller)
         3rd(sweep-flag for mirror)= denotes if to draw arc on left or right of the line joining start and end point (1->right and 0-> left)
Q/q -> Quadratic bezier curve
    have a single control point
    eg:- Q50,200 200,300
      first two are cordinates for control point(better if you try and get a visualization)
      last two points the coordinates for final points
C/c -> Cubic bezier curve
    have two control points(we can create a sine wave shape bu keeping both points on different direction)
    eg:- C225,350 375,350 400,300
      first two are cordinates for control point(better if you try and get a visualization)
      middle two are cordinates for control point(better if you try and get a visualization)
      last two points the coordinates for final points
Z/z -> closing 
    eg:-means joining the fist point to last point if just Z is added to path value
