There are two ways colors are combined- (ref- http://printingcode.runemadsen.com/lecture-color/)
1) subtractive - 
   -- All colors created with PAINT or INK will combine in a subtractive way
   -- means mixing all the paint colors will create black instead of white
2) additive - 
  -- All colors created with LIGHT will combine in a additive way
  -- means presence of all color is white while absence is black
